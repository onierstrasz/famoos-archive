<DT>Abstract:</DT>
  <DD>Tools support is recognised as a key issue in the reengineering of
  large scale object-oriented systems. However, due to
  the heterogeneity in today's object-oriented
  programming languages, it is hard to reuse
  reengineering tools across legacy systems. This
  paper proposes a language independent exchange
  model, so that tools may perform their tasks
  independent of the underlying programming
  language. Beside supporting reusability between
  tools, we expect that this exchange model will
  enhance the interoperability between tools for
  metrics, visualization, reorganisation and other
  reengineering activities.</DD>
