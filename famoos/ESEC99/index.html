<H2>
Objective</H2>

The ability to reengineer object-oriented legacy systems has become a
vital matter in today's software industry. Early adopters of the
object-oriented programming paradigm are now facing the problem of
transforming their object-oriented "legacy" systems into full-fledged
frameworks. Dealing with programs exceeding 10,000 lines of poorly
documented code definitely requires support from tools as well as
methodologies.

<P>The <I>Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering (WOOR)</I> wants
to gather people working on solutions for object-oriented legacy
systems.  We explicitly solicit experience reports from the software
industry as well as contributions from tool producers and methodology
providers. The workshop itself will be set up as a forum for
exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new ideas.

<P>Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

<UL>

<LI> Experience reports from object-oriented reengineering
projects</LI>

<LI>
Methods and techniques</LI>

<LI>
Tool-support</LI>

<LI>
Metrics and evaluation</LI>

<LI>
Migration to object-oriented frameworks</LI>

<LI>
Migration from procedural implementations</LI>

<LI>
Object-oriented schema integration</LI>

<LI>
Architectural issues</LI>

<LI>
Object-oriented analysis and design issues</LI>

<LI>
Design patterns in reengineering practices</LI>

<LI>
Reverse- and reengineering patterns</LI>

</UL>

<H2>
Intended Audience</H2>

The workshop is intended for software engineering professionals with
experience in object-oriented reengineering; either people who are
actively engaged in reengineering projects, or people who develop
methodologies and tools.  Similar workshops held at ESEC (<A
HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/ESEC97 /">ESEC'97</A>) as well
as other conferences (OOPSLA, ECOOP) show that it is possible to
gather a group of about 15 researchers and practitioners for a whole
day of fruitful discussions.



<H2>
About the Organizers</H2>

Both organizers are participating in ESPRIT research projects
concerning reengineering which are FAMOOS and ARES respectively.

<DD>
Serge Demeyer is a post-doctoral researcher at <A
HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch /~scg/">Software Composition Group</A>
(headed by <A HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~oscar/"> Professor
O. Nierstrasz</A> and located in the University of Berne -
Switzerland) where he serves as the technical leader of the ESPRIT
project <A HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/">FAMOOS</A>.  He is
active in the international object-oriented and hypermedia research
communities. Among others, he is a member of a program committee
(Webnet'99), he served twice as a workshop chair (Hypertext'99,
ECOOP'98), he is or was involved in the organisation of several
workshops (ECOOP'99 Workshop Object-Oriented Architectural Evolution;
ESEC/FSE'97 Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering; 2nd Workshop on
Open Hypermedia Systems) and he acted as a reviewer for many
hypermedia and software engineering related conferences and
journals. He completed his M.Sc. in 1987 and his Ph.D. in 1996, both
at the "Vrije Universiteit Brussel" (Belgium).
