<H2>
Objective</H2>

The ability to reengineer object-oriented legacy systems has become a
vital matter in today's software industry. Early adopters of the
object-oriented programming paradigm are now facing the problem of
transforming their object-oriented "legacy" systems into full-fledged
frameworks. Dealing with programs exceeding 10,000 lines of poorly
documented code definitely requires support from tools as well as
methodologies.

<P>The <I>Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering (WOOR)</I> wants
to gather people working on solutions for object-oriented legacy
systems.  We explicitly solicit experience reports from the software
industry as well as contributions from tool producers and methodology
providers. The workshop itself will be set up as a forum for
exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new ideas.

<P>Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

<UL>

<LI> Experience reports from object-oriented reengineering
projects</LI>

<LI>
Methods and techniques</LI>

<LI>
Tool-support</LI>

<LI>
Metrics and evaluation</LI>

<LI>
Migration to object-oriented frameworks</LI>

<LI>
Migration from procedural implementations</LI>

<LI>
Object-oriented schema integration</LI>

<LI>
Architectural issues</LI>

<LI>
Object-oriented analysis and design issues</LI>

<LI>
Design patterns in reengineering practices</LI>

<LI>
Reverse- and reengineering patterns</LI>

</UL>

<H2>
Intended Audience</H2>

The workshop is intended for software engineering professionals with
experience in object-oriented reengineering; either people who are
actively engaged in reengineering projects, or people who develop
methodologies and tools.  Similar workshops held at ESEC (<A
HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/ESEC97 /">ESEC'97</A>) as well
as other conferences (OOPSLA, ECOOP) show that it is possible to
gather a group of about 15 researchers and practitioners for a whole
day of fruitful discussions.


<H2>
Submission of Position Papers</H2>

<P>In order to make efficient use of the one day we have at our
disposal, we want to pay special attention to the preparation of the
workshop. We request each participant to submit a position paper in
advance (<= 10 pages), so that all participants can get acquinted with
the ideas that exist within the group. Each participant is supposed to
read all the submitted material, so that the workshop itself can be
devoted to discussion instead of presentations. Submissions will be
made electronically to facilitate the rapid exchange of
information.</P>

<P>Position papers will be collected in a technical report of TUV, so
that references too the position papers will be possible.</P>

<P>The upper limit for the number of participants is 20 and the particpants
will be selected on the basis of the submitted material. The maximum number of
particpants per position paper is limited to 2.</P>

<P>To submit a position paper, send HTML, pdf of postcript to <A HREF =
"mailto:demeyer@iam.unibe.ch">demeyer@iam.unibe.ch</A>.  Send a separate mail
with the abstract and the e-mail addresses of the authors and URL's of their
home pages <EM>in plain ASCII</EM>.  Submission guidelines at <A HREF =
"http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/ESEC99/howtosubmit.html">

Serge Demeyer is a post-doctoral researcher at <A
HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch /~scg/">Software Composition Group</A>
(headed by <A HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~oscar/"> Professor
O. Nierstrasz</A> and located in the University of Berne -
Switzerland) where he serves as the technical leader of the ESPRIT
project <A HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/">FAMOOS</A>.  He is
active in the international object-oriented and hypermedia research
communities. Among others, he is a member of a program committee
(Webnet'99), he served twice as a workshop chair (Hypertext'99,
ECOOP'98), he is or was involved in the organisation of several
workshops (ECOOP'99 Workshop Object-Oriented Architectural Evolution;
ESEC/FSE'97 Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering; 2nd Workshop on
Open Hypermedia Systems) and he acted as a reviewer for many
hypermedia and software engineering related conferences and
journals. He completed his M.Sc. in 1987 and his Ph.D. in 1996, both
at the "Vrije Universiteit Brussel" (Belgium).
