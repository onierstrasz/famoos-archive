<LI><EM>Round-Trip Software Engineering Using UML: From Architecture to Design and
Back</EM>

<DL>

    University of Southern California, USA)

<DT>Abstract:</DT><DD>
A key promise of software architecture research is that better software
systems can result from modeling their important aspects throughout
development. Choosing which system aspects to model and how to evaluate them
are two decisions that frame software architecture research. Part of the
software architecture community, primarily from academia, has focused on
analytic evaluation of architectural descriptions. Another part of the
community, primarily from industry, has chosen to model a wide range of issues
that arise in software development, with a family of models that span and
relate the issues. One problem that neither community has adequately addressed
to date is round-trip software engineering: consistently refining a high-level
model of a software system into a lower-level model (forward engineering) and
abstracting a low-level model into a higher-level one (reverse
engineering). This paper investigates the possibility of using the Unified
Modeling Language (UML), an object-oriented design language, to that end. The
paper assesses UML's suitability for modeling architectural concepts and
provides a framework for identifying and resolving mismatches within and
across different UML views, both at the same level of abstraction and across
lev-els of abstraction. Finally, the paper briefly discusses our current tool
support for round-trip software engineering.

<LI><EM>Understanding class hierarchies with KABA</EM>

<DL>
<DT>Authors:</DT>
<DD>Mirko Streckenbach (Universit&auml;t Passau, Germany)
  <BR>Gregor Snelting (Universit&auml;t Passau, Germany)</DD>

<DT>Abstract:</DT><DD>
  KABA is a prototype implementation of the Snelting/Tip analysis
  for JAVA. KABA combines dataflow analysis, type inference and concept
  lattices in order to perform a
  fine-grained analysis of member-access patterns in a class hierarchy
  together with a given set of applications. KABA computes a transformed
  hierarchy which is guaranteed to be 1. operationally equivalent,
  2. maximally factorized, 3. minimal. The new hierarchy in particular
  makes obvious which classes can be splitted and which cannot; which
  inheritance relations must be retained and which can be discarded. The
  paper presents several case studies on medium-sized JAVA programs.

<LI><EM>Extracting Reusable Software Architectures: A Slicing-Based Approach</EM>

<DL> <DT>Authors:</DT> <DD>Jianjun Zhao (Department of Computer Science and
Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Japan)<DD>

<DT>Abstract:</DT><DD> An alternative approach to developing reusable
components from scratch is to recover them from existing systems. Although
numerous techniques have been proposed to recover reusable components from
existing systems, most have focused on implementation code, rather than
software architecture. In this paper, we apply architectural slicing to
extract reusable architectures from existing architectural specifications.
Architectural slicing is designed to operate on the architectural
specification of a software system to provide knowledge about the high-level
structure of a software system, rather than the traditional program slicing
which is designed to operate on the source code of a program to provide the
low-level implementation details of a program.  <DD>

<LI><EM>SNiFF+ Talks to Rational Rose -- Interoperability using a Common Exchange Model</EM>

<DL>
<DT>Authors:</DT>
<DD>Sander Tichelaar (Software Composition Group, University of Berne, Switzerland)
  <BR>Serge Demeyer (Software Composition Group, University of Berne, Switzerland)</DD>

<DT>Abstract:</DT><DD> Nowadays development environments are required to be
open: users want to be able to work with a combination of their preferred
commercial and home-grown tools. TakeFive has opened up SNiFF+ with a
so-called "Symbol Table API"; Rational has opened up the UML tool Rose via the
so-called "Rose Extensibility Interface (REI)". On the other hand, efforts are
underway to define standards for exchanging information between case-tools;
CDIF being a notable example. This paper reports on our experience to generate
UML diagrams in Rational Rose from the symbol table in SNiFF+ using a standard
CDIF exchange format.  <DD>

<LI><EM>Object-Model Driven Abstraction-to-Code Mapping</EM>

<DL>
<DT>Authors:</DT>
<DD>Harald Gall (Distributed Systems Group, Technical University of
Vienna, Austria)
  <BR> Johannes Weidl (Distributed Systems Group, Technical University of
Vienna, Austria)</DD>

<DT>Abstract:</DT><DD> In object-oriented re-architecting, we face the
problem of improving the maintainability of procedural source code to
facilitate software evolution. We do this by transforming the
procedural code into an object-structure employing encapsulation to
the legacy data structures and their related procedures. To handle the
concept assignment problem, we established a stepwise
abstraction-to-code mapping via different object models based on
criteria such as the kind of information used in the modeling process,
model granularity, and model abstraction.  This mapping is
object-model (and thus forward-) driven rather than source-code (or
reverse-) driven and therefore enables the specific use of application
and domain knowledge. For that, an object-model driven approach
promises a high-level semantic class structure for an improved
software evolution process. We have applied our approach to a
real-world embedded software system to identify potential objects;
several results from the case study are given in the paper.
