WORKSHOP PROPOSAL&nbsp;<BR>
2nd Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering&nbsp;<BR>
ESEC/FSE'99 - Toulouse (France), September 1999</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Version 0.1 -- Latest Revision: January 29th, 1999</I></CENTER>

<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Objective</H2>
The ability to reengineer object-oriented legacy systems has become a vital
matter in today's software industry. Early adopters of the object-oriented
programming paradigm are now facing the problem of transforming their 
object-oriented
"legacy" systems into full-fledged frameworks. Dealing with programs exceeding
10,000 lines of poorly documented code definitely requires support from
tools as well as methodologies.
<P>The <I>Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering (WOOR)</I> wants to
gather people working on solutions for object-oriented legacy systems.
We explicitly solicit experience reports from the software industry as
well as contributions from tool producers and methodology providers. The
workshop itself will be set up as a forum for exchanging experiences, 
discussing
solutions, and exploring new ideas.
<P>Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
<UL>
<LI>
Experience reports from object-oriented reengineering projects</LI>

<LI>
Methods and techniques</LI>

<LI>
Tool-support</LI>

<LI>
Metrics and evaluation</LI>

<LI>
Migration to object-oriented frameworks</LI>

<LI>
Migration from procedural implementations</LI>

<LI>
Object-oriented schema integration</LI>

<LI>
Architectural issues</LI>

<LI>
Object-oriented analysis and design issues</LI>

<LI>
Design patterns in reengineering practices</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Intended Audience</H2>
The workshop is intended for software engineering professionals with experience
in object-oriented reengineering; either people who are actively engaged
in reengineering projects, or people who develop methodologies and tools.
Similar workshops held at ESEC (<A HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/ESEC99
/">ESEC'97</A>)
as well as other conferences (OOPSLA, ECOOP) show that it is possible to
gather a group of about 15 researchers and practitioners for a whole day
of fruitful discussions.
<H2>
Relevancy to ESEC/FSE '99</H2>
Reengineering of legacy systems has been an issue from the very beginning
of software engineering. Indeed, a software system often represents an
invaluable part of an organization's knowledge, consequently it must be
adapted to changing demands. However, the older a system grows, the riskier
it becomes to adapt such a "legacy system". Recently, reengineering has
become a topic of interest within the object-oriented community as well,
as is shown by reengineering workshops held at conferences on object-oriented
software engineering (OOPSLA, ECOOP). Hence, the relevancy of a workshop
on object-oriented reengineering in the ESEC/FSE'99 conference. This relevancy
has been confirmed by the organization of a similar workshop at previous
ESEC/FSE (see <A HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/ESEC97/">
http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/ESEC97/</A>),
which attracted no less than 23 participants from 12 different countries
in Europe, USA, Australia, and Japan..
<P>Both organisers are involved in a number of research projects concerning
reengineering so to attract quite a number of people who could be attracted
by this workshop at the ESEC/FSE -- especially people from industry.
<H2>
About the Organizers</H2>
Both organizers are participating in ESPRIT research projects concerning
reengineering which are FAMOOS and ARES respectively.

Serge Demeyer is a post-doctoral researcher at <A HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch
/~scg/">Software
Composition Group</A> (headed by <A HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~oscar/">
Professor
O. Nierstrasz</A> and located in the University of Berne - Switzerland)
where he serves as the technical leader of the ESPRIT project <A 
HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/">FAMOOS</A>.
He is active in the international object-oriented and hypermedia research
communities. Among others, he is a member of a program committee (Webnet'99),
he served twice as a workshop chair (Hypertext'99, ECOOP'98), he is or
was involved in the organisation of several workshops (ECOOP'99 Workshop
Object-Oriented Architectural Evolution; ESEC/FSE'97 Workshop on 
Object-Oriented
Reengineering; 2nd Workshop on Open Hypermedia Systems) and he acted as
a reviewer for many hypermedia and software engineering related conferences
and journals. He completed his M.Sc. in 1987 and his Ph.D. in 1996, both at the "Vrije
Universiteit Brussel" (Belgium).
