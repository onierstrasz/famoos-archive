*  README file for sniff2famix, version 1.1
*
*  sniff2famix
*     is a program that produces information according to the FAMIX
*     Model from the symbol table of a SNiFF+ project using the CDIF
*     standard for information exchange.  
*
*  Author: Sander Tichelaar, tichel@iam.unibe.ch
*     based on work by Holger Baer and Serge Demeyer.

*  For more information about the FAMIX Model
*  and the CDIF format, see:

*********************************************************************


The distribution is a gzipped tarred file, expanding into a directory,
called sniff2famix<version number>. In this directory you will find the
source code of sniff2famix. 

Prerequisite for using this software is an installation of SNiFF+. The
current version of sniff2famix has been tested with SNiFF+ 3.0.1.
sniff2famix makes use of the Symbol Table API of SNiFF+.

Questions, comments and/or suggestions are welcome! Direct them to
Sander Tichelaar, tichel@iam.unibe.ch.

1. INSTALLATION

 1. un(g)zip and untar (if needed) the distribution file (or just
    unzip . It will expand into a directory, called
    sniff2famix<version number>.  

    The directory contains:

    Source code:
     sniff2famix.c 
     extractor.c
     extractor.h
     makefile       

    Miscellaneous:
     sniff2famix      // binary for use with SNiFF+ 3.0.1 on Solaris 2.5.1
     infxch11CDIF.txt // CDIF definition of the FAMOOS Information
                      // Exchange Model
     README	      // this file 

 2. The binary is compiled with the SNiFF+ 3.0.1 libraries. To use this
    program with any other version of SNiFF+, you need to recompile it
    with the right libraries for your platform. The SNIFF_DIR
    environment should point rightly to your SNiFF+ installation
    (which it normally does, if SNiFF+ is installed rightly). Edit the
    makefile so that SNIFF_LIB indicates the right library for your
    platform:

    The file libSniffApi.a can normally be found in
      SNIFF_LIB = $SNIFF_DIR/symbol_API/lib.<yourplatform>/libSniffApi.a  
                                            --------------
					    
    Running make should compile the stuff nicely.

 3. run the program (see RUNNING THE PROGRAM below).


2. RUNNING THE PROGRAM

 To run sniff2famix you have to have a copy of SNiFF+ running.

 sniff2famix <SNiff+ project> starts SNiFF+, queries the symboltable
 of a SNiFF+ project to extract information according to the FAMIX
 model and puts it on stdout (or a file, if specified) using the CDIF
 format.
 
 For more options, run sniff2famix -h. This will result in:

  Usage: sniff2famix [-options] <sniff-project>

  where options include:
    -help, -h, -?               print out this message
    -version, -v                print out the version of sniff2famix
    -noHeader, -nh              don't put CDIF header in output
    -level <1-4>                level of reification in the FAMOOS model.
                                Default = 1. The higher the level, the more
                                information is included.
    +/-access                   show or hide variableAccess (only useful when
                                level>=3. Default = show.
    +/-invocation               show or hide methodInvocation (only useful when
                                level>=3. Default = show.
    +/-sourceAnchor             show or hide source anchors for CDIF entities.
                                Default = show.
    +/-packages                 show or hide package names. Default = false.
    +/-fullInheritanceDef       show or hide full InheritanceDefinition. If false,
                                the attrs accessControlQualifier and index of
                                InheritanceDefinition are suppressed.
                                Default = hide.
    -publisherName, -pn <name>  set name of publisher.
    -o <filename>               write output to file with name filename.
                                Default = stdout.

 
3. IMPORTANT!!

 - Apparently a project can only be opened via the SNiFF+ symbol table
   API if the SNIFF+ Working Environment of this project is set as the
   default working environment. sniff2famix will hang in this
   case. Don't forget to kill SNiFF+ after killing sniff2famix.

 - If the project to parse contains any items that need preprocessing,
   be sure that in SNiFF+ the preprocessor is enabled for this project
   (see Project Attributes > Parser > Preproccesing before
   Parsing). Otherwise sniff2famix (and SNiFF+ itself) may provide
   false information.

4. OTHER REMARKS

 - sniff2famix doesn't provide all information as specified in the
   FAMIX model. This is mainly, because the SNiFF+ symbol table and
   its API do not provide the information. The output contains all
   mandatory information though.

 - all subprojects of a project are also parsed.
