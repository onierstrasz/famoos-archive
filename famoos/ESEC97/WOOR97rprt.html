<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Report: Workshop on Object-Oriented Re-engineering (WOOR'97)

<h2>Context</h2>

<P>The ability to reengineer object-oriented systems has become a
vital matter in today's software industry. Early adopters of the
object-oriented programming paradigm are now facing the problem of
transforming their object-oriented 'legacy' systems into full-fledged
frameworks. Dealing with programs exceeding 10,000 lines of badly
documented code definitely requires support from methodologies as well
as tools.</P>

<P>During the ESEC/FSE'97 conference (1), a workshop was organised
with the explicit goal to gather people working on solutions for
object-oriented legacy systems. In here we report on the experiences
exchanged, the solutions discussed and the ideas explored. More
information can be found in the workshop proceedings [Demeyer,Gall'97]
or via the world-wide web
(http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/ESEC97/).</P>

<P>Prior to the workshop, participants were requested to submit a
position paper describing their work on OO re-engineering. The
accepted papers were collected in the workshop proceedings and
distributed to the participants in advance so that people could get
familiar with the material beforehand. 14 position papers were
accepted for the workshop with 26 different authors. The workshop
itself gathered 23 persons from 12 different countries in Europe, USA,
Australia, and Japan.</P>

<P>The workshop started with a quick tour of the submitted papers
covering topics such as code analysis and visualization, repositories,
metrics, design patterns, cluster analysis, meta models,
restructuring, testing, and architecture. Based on these topics, we
split up the group in two separate task forces.</P>


<h2>Analysis and Repositories</h2>

<P>The first task force discussed analysis techniques and repository
technology available for re-engineering. A prominent question was to
what extent object-oriented re-engineering is different from
'conventional' re-engineering. It was concluded that re-engineering
depends largely on the amount of structure inside the legacy system:
OO re-engineering may benefit from explicit structuring primitives
such classes and inheritance but --especially in hybrid approaches--
one cannot be sure that software engineers applied those
primitives.</P>

<P>A second question was whether it is worthwhile to do a dynamic
analysis, or whether a static analysis is sufficient. The question
remained unanswered: dynamic analysis is hard to do and generates huge
amounts of data, and it is not sure whether the benefits outweigh the
costs. On the other hand, pure static analysis cannot address all of
the re-engineering issues.</P>

<P>Concerning repository technology, it was agreed that no approach
can store all available information and so trade-offs must be made to
restrict the repository to a manageable size. This trade off is
especially important, since a re-engineering repository must be able
to store extra information in addition to what can be extracted from
source code. An important area for such extra information is what is
required by all kinds of visualization tools.</P>

<P>Finally the participants compiled a list of the tools they have
found useful during their re-engineering projects.</P>


<h2>Restructuring and Tools</h2>

<P>The second task force discussed how one can restructure
object-oriented systems and to what extent tool support is
required. The work was organised around a number of questions, the
first being 'What is the problem?'. Here we came up with a
non-exhaustive list of cases where re-engineering is appropriate; some
of them were specific for OO others were not. Part of the list was
based on the case studies of the FAMOOS project [FAMOOS'97]. The
second question was 'How serious is the problem?'.  Everybody agreed
that it was imperative to publish work on good examples of the
necessity to restructure software systems.</P>

<P>The third question discussed in length was 'How do we restructure a
legacy system?'. The task force classified the answer into three
layers of targets for restructuring: (1) classes, (2) patterns, and
(3) frameworks. For restructuring into classes, it seems that starting
from (persistent) data is at least a workable approach. After
identifying the classes one can concentrate on the methods and finally
start to refactor the class hierachy to make the system more flexible.
Concerning restructuring into patterns, the general feeling was that
it would be useful and that it is feasible to a certain extent. To
restructure into frameworks, the group pointed out that frameworks are
not necessarily implemented in an OO medium and that the hardest
problem seems to be identifying the common functionality that needs to
be factored out in the framework design.</P>

<P>The final question concerned how much of the original system is to
be preserved in the restructuring process. We agreed that it is hard
to come up with a fool-proof definition of 'semantic preserving' or
(what seems to be the weaker variant) 'behaviour
preserving'. Moreover, proving that a certain restructuring operation
preserves behaviour is even harder -- all one can do is agree on a
certain model and then prove that the operation preserves behaviour
with respect to that model. Viewn from that perspective, it seems that
it might be useful to define a model where it is easy to come up with
behaviour preserving operations and worry about how to extract that
model later.</P>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<P>The workshop showed that the need for object-oriented
re-engineering can be seen from at least two perspectives: (1)
re-engineering procedural systems to object-oriented; and (2)
re-engineering object-oriented systems to improve their quality. The
amount of problems that have to be adressed in each of these
approaches showed that more practical research is required. ESPRIT
projects such as FAMOOS and ARES, that concentrate on several parts of
the problem, can contribute a lot to solve at least some of the
research issues.</P>
