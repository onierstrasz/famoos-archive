<H2>Workshop Agenda</H2>

<P>It was a bit difficult, but finally we decided on a format where each
of the authors quickly (= 4 minutes per paper) presents their position
statement followed by a short (=2 minutes) question round.  Assuming
that all participants read the material beforehand, this part of the
agenda mainly serves as a 'get to know each other'.</P>

<P>For this scheme to work well, it implies your co-operation. Especially,
we ask all presenters to respect strictly the 4 minutes presentation
time, which corresponds roughly to 2 slides.
<BR>During this 4 minutes we want you to stick to the following format:
<BR>- Who are you ? (= all the authors of the paper present at the
    workshop)
<BR>- Why are you here ?
<BR>- What is the position you defend ? (People have read the paper, so
    DO NOT GO INTO TECHNICAL DETAILS)
<BR>- What are the topics you want to discuss at the workshop
</P>

<P>During these presentations and questions, me and Harald will collect
the discussion topics raised in a list. Using that list, we will then
form clusters of interest and split the group into smaller 'task
forces'.  During the afternoon, those task forces will study a number
of issues in greater detail. At the end of the day, we will come back
in a plenary session to exchange the results.</P>

  Conclusion of the workshop
  Future directions
</PRE>

<H2>Objective</H2>

<P>The ability to reengineer object-oriented legacy systems has
become a vital matter in today's software industry. Early
adopters of the object-oriented programming paradigm are now facing
the problem of transforming their object-oriented &quot;legacy&quot;
systems into full-fledged frameworks.  Dealing with programs exceeding
10,000 lines of badly documented code definitely requires support from
tools as well as methodologies.</P>

<P>The <EM>Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering</EM> wants to
gather people working on solutions for object-oriented legacy
systems. We explicitly solicit experience reports from the software
industry as well as contributions from tool producers and methodology
providers. The workshop itself will be set up as a forum for
exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new
ideas.</P>

<P>Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Experience reports from object-oriented reengineering projects</LI>

<LI>Methods and techniques</LI>

<LI>Tool-support</LI>

<LI>Metrics and evaluation</LI>

<LI>Migration to object-oriented frameworks</LI>

<LI>Migration from procedural implementations</LI>

<LI>Object-oriented schema integration</LI>

<LI>Architectural issues</LI>

<LI>Object-oriented analysis and design issues</LI>

<LI>Design patterns in reengineering practices</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Intended Audience</H2>

<P>The workshop is intended for software engineering professionals
with experience in object-oriented reengineering; either people who
are actively engaged in reengineering projects, or people who develop
methodologies and tools.  Similar workshops held at other conferences
(OOPSLA'95, <A
HREF="http://www.nokia.com/oopsla96ws18/">OOPSLA'96</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.ecoop97.jyu.fi/Workshops/workshop8.html">ECOOP'97</A>),
show that it is possible to gather a group of about 10 persons for a
whole day of fruitful discussions.</P>
