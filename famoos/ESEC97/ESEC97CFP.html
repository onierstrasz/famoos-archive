<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
 <BR>ESEC/FSE'97 Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering
 <BR>Zurich, Friday September 26, 1997 </H1>
<CENTER>
<P><STRONG>http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/ESEC97/</STRONG></P>
<P><EM>Version 1.0 -- Latest Revision: May, 14th, 1997</EM></P>
</CENTER>

<H2>Objective</H2>

<P>The ability to reengineer object-oriented legacy systems has
become a vital matter in today's software industry. Early
adopters of the object-oriented programming paradigm are now facing
the problem of transforming their object-oriented &quot;legacy&quot;
systems into full-fledged frameworks.  Dealing with programs exceeding
10,000 lines of badly documented code definitely requires support from
tools as well as methodologies.</P>

<P>The <EM>Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering</EM> wants to
gather people working on solutions for object-oriented legacy
systems. We explicitly solicit experience reports from the software
industry as well as contributions from tool producers and methodology
providers. The workshop itself will be set up as a forum for
exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new
ideas.</P>

<P>Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Experience reports from object-oriented reengineering projects</LI>

<LI>Methods and techniques</LI>

<LI>Tool-support</LI>

<LI>Metrics and evaluation</LI>

<LI>Migration to object-oriented frameworks</LI>

<LI>Migration from procedural implementations</LI>

<LI>Object-oriented schema integration</LI>

<LI>Architectural issues</LI>

<LI>Object-oriented analysis and design issues</LI>

<LI>Design patterns in reengineering practices</LI>
</UL>


<H2>ESEC/FSE'97</H2>

<P>The Workshop is organised in conjunction with the "Sixth European
Software Engineering Conference / Fifth ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the
Foundations of Software Engineering" Conference, to be held in Zurich -
Switzerland from September 22-25, 1997.
<BR><A HREF = "http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/congress/esec97.html"> http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/congress/esec97.html</A></P>

<H2>Intended Audience</H2>

<P>The workshop is intended for software engineering professionals
with experience in object-oriented reengineering; either people who
are actively engaged in reengineering projects, or people who develop
methodologies and tools.  Similar workshops held at other conferences
(OOPSLA'95, <A
HREF="http://www.nokia.com/oopsla96ws18/">OOPSLA'96</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.ecoop97.jyu.fi/Workshops/workshop8.html">ECOOP'97</A>),
show that it is possible to gather a group of about 10 persons for a
whole day of fruitful discussions.</P>

<H2>
Preparation</H2>

<P>In order to make efficient use of the one day we have at our
disposal, we want to pay special attention to the preparation of the
workshop.  We request each participant to submit a position paper in
advance, so that all participants can get acquinted with the ideas
that exist within the group. Each participant is supposed to read all
the submitted material, so that the workshop itself can be devoted to
discussion instead of presentations.  Submissions will be made
electronically to facilitate the rapid exchange of information.</P>

<P>The upper limit for the number of participants is 20 and the
particpants will be selected on the basis of the submitted
material. The maximum number of particpants per position paper is
limited to 2.</P>

<H2>
Important Dates</H2>

<UL>
 <LI>Friday, 27.07.97: Submission of position papers due.
 <LI>Friday, 15.08.97: Notification of acceptance.
 <LI>Monday, 01.09.97: Preliminary Program available.
 <LI>Friday, 26.09.97: Workshop on OO Renginerring
</UL>


<H2>
Submission Guidelines</H2>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Be standard.</STRONG>
There is lot's of work on re-engineering out there, which gives rise to
some terminology conflicts. We encourage people to use the
re-engineering taxonomy defined in <EM>Reverse Engineering and Design
Recovery : A Taxonomy</EM> by E.J. Chikofsky and J.H. Cross II -- IEEE
Software, January 1990. Check <A
HREF = "http://www.tcse.org/revengr/taxonomy.html">
http://www.tcse.org/revengr/taxonomy.html</A> for an online summary.
</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Be electronic.</STRONG> Submit your position paper in HTML
(preferably), postcript or PDF, so that we can collect all of the
submissions on a web-site. A separate abstract including the e-mail
addresses of the authors and URL's of their home pages MUST be
submitted in HTML.

<BR>Submit everything by e-mail to [<A HREF = "mailto:demeyer@iam.unibe.ch">
demeyer@iam.unibe.ch</A>].</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Be focussed.</STRONG>
Propose only one idea. We all know that you are a quality researcher
with plenty of good ideas. Only, we have limited resources and we must
focus. Please keep all position papers under five pages.</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Be relevant.</STRONG>
Propose an idea that is relevant to object-oriented
re-engineering. Refer to the list of specific areas
of interest.</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Be innovative.</STRONG>
Propose some recent idea that still has some unfinished sides to it. It
is supposed to be a WORKshop, not a mini-conference.</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Be a rebel.</STRONG>
Neglect these guidelines if you feel that your idea needs
a special treatment in some way.</LI>

</OL>
