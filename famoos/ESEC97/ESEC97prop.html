<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>WORKSHOP PROPOSAL <BR>
ESEC/FSE'97 Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering <BR>
Zurich, Friday September 26, 1997 </H1>

<CENTER>
<P><EM>Version 0.1 -- Latest Revision: April 17, 1997</EM> </P>
</CENTER>

<H2>Objective</H2>

<P>The ability to reengineer object-oriented legacy systems has
become a vital matter in today's software industry. Early
adopters of the object-oriented programming paradigm are now facing
the problem of transforming their object-oriented &quot;legacy&quot;
systems into full-fledged frameworks.  Dealing with programs exceeding
10,000 lines of badly documented code definitely requires support from
tools as well as methodologies.</P>

<P>The <EM>Workshop on Object-Oriented Reengineering</EM> wants to
gather people working on solutions for object-oriented legacy
systems. We explicitly solicit experience reports from the software
industry as well as contributions from tool producers and methodology
providers. The workshop itself will be set up as a forum for
exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new
ideas.</P>

<P>Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Experience reports from object-oriented reengineering projects</LI>

<LI>Methods and techniques</LI>

<LI>Tool-support</LI>

<LI>Metrics and evaluation</LI>

<LI>Migration to object-oriented frameworks</LI>

<LI>Migration from procedural implementations</LI>

<LI>Object-oriented schema integration</LI>

<LI>Architectural issues</LI>

<LI>Object-oriented analysis and design issues</LI>

<LI>Design patterns in reengineering practices</LI>
</UL>

<H2>About the Organizers</H2>

<P>
The organizers of the workshop are from the University of Berne,
Switzerland and the Technical University of Vienna, Austria. Serge
Demeyer, from the University of Berne, is a member of the <A
HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/">Software Composition Group</A>
headed by <A HREF="http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~oscar/">Professor
O. Nierstrasz</A>. Harald Gall, from the Technical University of
Vienna, is a member of the <A
HREF="http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/Research/">Distributed Systems
Group</A> headed by <A
HREF="http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/Staff/mj/mehdi.html">Professor
M. Jazayeri</A>. Both groups are participating in ESPRIT research
projects concerning reengineering which are FAMOOS and ARES
respectively.

<DD>Serge Demeyer research focuses primarily on possible
cross-fertilizations between the <EM>software engineering</EM> and
<EM>hypermedia</EM> domains. He is currently the co-ordinator of the <A

project at the University of Berne. Serge Demeyer co-organised the
<A HREF="http://www.daimi.aau.dk/~kock/OHS-HT96/">'2nd Workshop on
Open Hypermedia Systems'</A> and participated in many other Open
Hypermedia Workshops. He holds a Ph.D.  in Computer Science (1997)

<H2>Intended Audience</H2>

<P>The workshop is intended for software engineering professionals
with experience in object-oriented reengineering; either people who
are actively engaged in reengineering projects, or people who develop
methodologies and tools.  Similar workshops held at other conferences
(OOPSLA'95, <A
HREF="http://www.nokia.com/oopsla96ws18/">OOPSLA'96</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.ecoop97.jyu.fi/Workshops/workshop8.html">ECOOP'97</A>),
show that it is possible to gather a group of about 15 persons for a
whole day of fruitful discussions.</P>

<H2>Relevancy to ESEC/FSE '97</H2>

<P>Reengineering of legacy systems was an issue from the very
beginning of software engineering. Indeed, a software system often
represents an invaluable part of an organization's knowledge,
consequently it must be adapted to changing demands. However, the
older a system grows, the riskier it becomes to adapt such a
&quot;legacy system&quot;. Recently, reengineering has become a topic
of interest within the object-oriented community as well, as is shown
by reengineering workshops held at conferences on object-oriented
software engineering (OOPSLA'95, OOPSLA'96, ECOOP'97).  Hence, the
relevancy of a workshop on <EM>object-oriented reengineering</EM> in the
ESEC/FSE'97 conferenc.</P>

<P>Note that both organizers are involved in a number of research
projects concerning reengineering. Consequently, the necessary
contacts are available to attract a number of people that wouldn't
otherwise attend the conference -- especially people from industry.</P>
