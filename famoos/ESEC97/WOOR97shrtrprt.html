   Report: Workshop on Object-Oriented Re-engineering (WOOR'97)
   ============================================================

The ability to reengineer object-oriented systems has become a vital matter in
today's software industry. Early adopters of the object-oriented programming
paradigm are now facing the problem of transforming their object-oriented
'legacy' systems into full-fledged frameworks. Dealing with programs exceeding
10,000 lines of badly documented code definitely requires support from
methodologies as well as tools.

During the ESEC/FSE'97 conference, a workshop was organised with the explicit
goal to gather people working on solutions for object-oriented legacy
systems. The following topics were covered: code analysis and visualization,
repositories, metrics, design patterns, cluster analysis, meta models,
restructuring, testing, and architecture.

The workshop showed that the need for object-oriented re-engineering can be
seen from at least two perspectives: (1) re-engineering procedural systems to
object-oriented; and (2) re-engineering object-oriented systems to improve
their quality. The amount of problems that have to be adressed in each of these
approaches showed that more practical research is required. ESPRIT projects
such as FAMOOS and ARES, that concentrate on several parts of the problem, can
contribute a lot to solve at least some of the research issues.
