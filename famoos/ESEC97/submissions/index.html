Detecting unreachable code in C++ programs is frequently necessary in
large software projects to help remove excess software baggage, select
regression tests, and support software reuse studies.  The language
complexity introduced by class inheritance, friendships, and template
instantiations in C++ requires a carefully-designed model to catch all
necessary dependencies for correct reachability analysis while
remaining practical for large systems.  We describe such a C++ model
with the granularity of top-level declarations and discuss our
experiences in applying reachability analysis tools based on this
model to industrial C++ code.

Reengineering requires modelling and understanding a system on many
levels of abstraction. <DFN>Grouping</DFN> is a concept for building
abstract views on object-oriented systems. Grouping is defined
formally based on graph theory. Visualizing a system containing groups
and manipulating a corresponding model by tools can be defined
straight forward.

Searching for methods and ways to transform object-oriented legacy
systems into new framework-based applications is the main intention of
the ESPRIT project FAMOOS. The partners involved expect a tremendous
increase in software flexibility from this approach. This results in
the understanding that effective reengineering of large-scale
applications is not feasible without sufficient tool support. At this
time there are already a few considerations about what tool support
for reengineering should look like. This paper gives an overview of
the work at Daimler-Benz regarding this. It starts with a short
summary of the different tasks that could be related to the term
reengineering. Subsequently, a generic proposal for a possible tool
architecture is given. Finally the paper introduces a few
tool-prototypes which are currently being developed at Daimler-Benz.

The third generation OO methodology OPEN (Object-oriented Process,
Environment and Notation) encompasses the full lifecycle of software
development. It is structured in terms of a fully objectified
lifecycle together with a set of Tasks and Techniques. Here, those
Tasks and Techniques pertinent to re-engineering are discussed
together with evaluation of their relevance to migration issues (from
a traditional information system to an object-oriented architecture).

</P>

<P>An object oriented reengineering of a legacy system led to the
development of the extension complexity concept, which enables fast
detection of problematic algorithms. A software system may be
considered as an implementation of a number of different
algorithms. An evaluation of the extension complexities of these
algorithms can reveal algorithms, that are difficult to implement and
to extend. Similar to space and time complexities the extension
complexity of an algorithm may be evaluated in few minutes and give an
indication of the suitability of the algorithm. </P>

<P>The main goal of this project was to design a semi-automatic tool
which, from a Merise analysis schema, produces an OMT analysis
schema. This work was based on a real-world case provided by a company
wishing to migrate to object-oriented techniques in order to improve
its maintenance process and software quality. We extracted translation
and transformation rules, in a systematic way, from the existing
Merise analysis of the case study. A comparison of both methods led to
define a set of automatic rules and a set of concepts for which there
is no correspondence between the two analysis representations.

This paper describes a method for preserving behaviour during the
reorganisation of object-oriented legacy systems written in standard
object-oriented languages (e.g. C++, Smalltalk, Java, ADA). The method
consists of three phases: In the first phase the legacy systems is
transformed into an adaptive program. During the second phase the
system is reorganised in a behaviour preserving way to fulfill new
flexibility requirements.  Finally the resulting adaptive program is
retransformed to the original object-oriented language. The result of
this process is a more flexible and adaptable system which is proven
to be behaviourally equivalent to the source system.

In our workshop proposal we present a prototype approach to help the
extraction of architectural information in the re-engineering process.
</P>

<P>
Commonly, the re-engineering life-cycle has been defined as a
succession of the following tasks: analysis of requirements, model
capture (understanding the system), problem detection, problem
analysis, reorganisation and change propagation. We have evaluated the
benefit of a prototyping approach with a focus on model capture.
Although prototyping is a known approach to evaluate the application
feasibility, costs, comparison and validation of choices, we focus in
this paper on the aspects of prototyping that are helpful for
re-engineering. We describe a pattern to use prototyping to extract
architectural information, especially when there is a lack of good
documentation and the original developers are difficult to access. A
prototype can help to extract information from engineers, to detect
problems that should have a solution in the existing software and to
focus on different aspects like communication or user interfaces. And
a running prototype demands awareness of behavioural aspects of the
extracted structure.

Complex data structures like lists and trees are difficult to
implement in C in a way that programmers have no difficulties to
maintain and reuse the source code. Thus, converting such data
structures into instances of generic C++ components in order to
increase the maintainabilty of the code is a reasonable task.
Replacing data structures with instances of generic data structures is
a non-trivial issue. Handling dependencies accordingly causes even
more effort in the conversion. This paper points out the issues of
replacing data structures with instances of generic components
provided by libraries. We briefly desribe the transformation process,
related issues and give an outlook on future activities in this area.
This paper tries to stimulate a discussion of how generic source code
components can influence reengineering and maintenance activities.

<P>We show that cluster analysis can support the extraction of an 
object oriented re-design in that it can
<BR>(1) group instance variables into classes based on the common use
    of global in the legacy source code;
<BR>(2) assign methods to classes based on the use of variables 
    in the procedures as occurring in the legacy code;
<BR>(3) visualize the common use of variables and procedures in the
    legacy system.
<BR>We discuss how we employed cluster analysis in the extraction
of an object-oriented design from a 100 KLOC COBOL legacy system.

</P>

<P>This paper provides a new approach for object-oriented
reengineering. One of the difficulty in software testing and
maintenance has been identified as caused by the convention that code
and its tests are developed and described separately. This paper
develops a method of built-in test (BIT) for OO reengineering. The
advantage of this method is that the BITs in reengineered OO software
(OOS) can be inherited and reused as that of code. Therefore building
tests in the conventional software during OO reengineering can be a
significant reengineering approach for the existing OO legacy
systems.</P>

<P>A survey has been designed to seek the practical foundation of base
process activities (BPAs) in the software industry and to support the
research in modelling the software processes. Seven processes with 63
BPAs for object-oriented reengineering have been modelled and analyzed
in the survey. This paper reports a subset of the survey on the BPAs
for OO reengineering processes. Each BPA in the reengineering
processes is benchmarked on the attributes of mean importance, ratio
of practice and effectiveness. Based on the benchmark data, the OO
reengineering processes in a software organization can be diagnosed
and evaluated quantitatively, and process improvement opportunities
can be identified and prioritized based on the importance and
effectiveness of the BPAs within the processes.</P>
