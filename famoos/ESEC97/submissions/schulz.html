<H3>Abstract</H3>
<P>This paper describes a method for preserving behaviour during the reorganisation of object-oriented legacy
systems written in standard object-oriented languages (e.g. C++, Smalltalk, Java, ADA). The method consists
of three phases: In the first phase the legacy systems is transformed into an adaptive program. During the
second phase the system is reorganised in a behaviour preserving way to fulfill new flexibility requirements.
Finally the resulting adaptive program is retransformed to the original object-oriented language. The result of this
process is a more flexible and adaptable system which is proven to be behaviourally equivalent to the source
system.
</P> 

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>Due to the hope to produce more quickly more flexible and adaptable systems, the object-oriented paradigm
has been widely adopted in the industry several years ago. Today there are systems of millions of lines of
code, which are nor flexible nor adaptable. Because it would be very expensive to redesign and reimplement
these systems from the scratch, there is an increasing interest in re-engineering techniques.
</P>
<P>The re-engineering process is a difficult task which can not be done without user-intervention. However some
parts of the process are very error-prone when done manually: For example even minor changes like changing the
name of a method can result in syntactic and semantic problems or a big portion of code has to be changed.
</P>
<P>Tools to ease these reorganisation tasks must be proven to be behaviour-preserving, since otherwise they
would not be used by any software-engineer. Reasonning about behaviour in C++ (the most widespread object-oriented
language) or other object-oriented languages is a very hard problem, in the most cases it is even undecidable,
if a change made to a piece of code preserves the systems behaviour (for an example consider pointer-arithmetic
in C++).
</P>
<P>To overcome these difficulties, the paradigm of adaptive programming was proposed. Systems implemented in
an adaptive language are easier to change, because very often changes to the object-structure does not result
in changes to the code. This makes it especially easy to prove the behavioural equivalence of the source system
and the reorganised system.
</P>
<P>While probably it will be easier to maintain adaptive programs, all over the world there are millions of lines
of legacy code. A complete redesign and reimplementation of these systems from the scratch in an adatptive
programming language would be too expensive
(in terms of time and needed human resources). Therefore in this paper we propose the following approach:
Source and destination language is the language of the source code of the system to reorganise. The steps of
altering the system will be performed on the system translated into an adaptive language. Thus we combine the
advantages of using a widespread object-oriented language and the use the adaptive paradigm, in which reorganisations
can easily be proven to be behaviour preserving. 
</P>

<H3>Adaptive Programming</H3>
<P>The paradigm of adaptive programming was proposed be Karl Lieberherr and his group [Lieb93a]. The main idea is the separation of
method implementation from the object-structure. Consider the following example to get an impression of how
adaptive programming works:
</P>
<P>There are two classes named <b>Table</b> and <b>Thing</b>. A table can contain things. The code for a method of
<b>Table</b>,
which prints out all the contained things would contain an iteration over the set of things, calling the
<b>print</b>-method on each item.
<P>When you now feel, that you want to structure your things better, you need drawers. The redesign results
in a new class <b>Drawer</b>, which contains things. A table now does not contain things directly but
drawers with things. Of course you have to change the implementation now to capture these changes: The method <b>print</b>
of <b>Table</b> will have to iterate over all drawers calling the <b>print</b>-method of each of them, which itself
iterates over all contained things to finally print them using the <b>print</b>-method of <b>Thing</b>. 
</P>
<P>If you had been using and adaptive programming language, the code would have been identically for both
structures. The implementation for the method <b>print</b> of <b>Table</b> could be the following:
</P>
<P>OPERATION void print() FROM Table TO Thing { PREFIX Thing {print();} }
</P>
<P>For more information on adaptive programming refer to [Lieb93a].
</P>

<H3>A proposed solution</H3>
<P>The following image depicts the proposed solution:
</P>
<IMG SRC="shulz.gif" ALT="ESEC-Picture">
<P>The most difficult task might be the transformation from the original source code to an adaptive program.
This transformation must be proven to be behaviour-preserving. However we think that there are good chances
to find the code responsible for the navigation through the object-structure: Every loop which accesses aggregated
or associated objects in its body is a candidate for such a transformation.
</P>
<P>
Once the code is transformed into an adaptive program, changes to the structure can be made relatively easy:
Since the implementation of the methods has seldom to be changed and since the behaviour of a systems is
defined by its methods, the prove for the behaviouring property is simpler, that it would have been in standard
object-oriented languages. Refer to [Huer95] to see, how this can be proven.
</P>
<P>
The last step should not be to complicated, either: Since the navigation-directive and the object-structure is
given, it is relatively straight forward to get back to the original implementation language. 
</P> 

<H3>Summary and future work</H3>
<H4>Summary</H4>
<P>Because of the increasing amount of object-oriented software which is not flexible enough to be maintained
and extended in a sensible way, these legacy systems need to be re-engineered into flexible frameworks. Due to
the size of these systems (several millons of lines of code) it is hard to do this without tool-support. One
important phase in the re-engineering life-cycle is the reorganisation-phase. In this phase the source-code
modifications take place. Because a tool which is not proven to preserve behaviour during reorganisation would
not been acceptable for software-engineers, it must be possible to prove this property. Proving behavioural
invariance for standard object-oriented languages is undecidable. In this paper, we propose a solution of this
problem using adaptive programming concepts and transformations between adaptive systems and the source systems.
</P>
<H4>Future Work</H4>
<ul>
<li>Finding "navigation-code" in the legacy systems
<li>Finding reasonable transformations for the "navigation-code"
<li>Evaluation of the transformed system: Is the code still understandable?
<li>Prototyping this approach
</ul>
