<DT>Abstract:</DT>
  <DD>Recovering architectural documentation from code is crucial to 
maintaining and  reengineering  software systems.  Reverse engineering and
program understanding approaches are often limited by the fact that (1) they
propose a fixed set of predefined views and (2) they consider either purely
static or purely dynamic views of the application. 
In this paper we present an environment supporting the generation of tailorable
views of object-oriented systems from both static and dynamic
information.  Our approach is based on the combination of user-defined queries
which allow an engineer to create high-level abstractions and to produce
views using these abstractions.</DD>
