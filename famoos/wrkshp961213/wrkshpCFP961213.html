 <H1>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
 <BR>2nd FAMOOS Workshop -- Methodology Providers
 <BR>Bern, Friday December, 13th
 </H1>
 <EM>Version 1.3 -- Latest Revision: November 28th, 1996</EM>
</CENTER>

<H2>
Objective</H2>

The methodology providers in the FAMOOS project (i.e.,
FZI-Forschungscentrum Informatik and UOB-University of Bern) are
assigned the responsibility for devising a generic object-oriented
reengineering methodology. Being research institutes, the methodology
providers are especially well suited for that task, as they have a good
overview on the state of the art in object-oriented software
engineering, having even contributed to the field themselves.

<P>To remain at the leading edge in object-oriented research, the
methodology providers must continue to work on innovative ideas. The
FAMOOS project serves as a testbed for a number of these ideas, so it
is in the interest of the project to identify viable ideas as early as
possible. The methodology providers have agreed that their next FAMOOS
meeting will be devoted to a workshop on to the issue of idea
identification.

<H2>
Preparation</H2>

In order to make efficient use of time and money, the methodology
providers are paying special attention to the preparation of the
meeting.  Each member within the respective groups is requested to
submit some material in advance, so that all members can get acquinted
with the existing ideas. Each member must read all the submitted
material, so that the the meeting itself can be devoted to the
discussion of ideas rather than on their presentation.  Submissions
must be made by e-mail [demeyer@iam.unibe.ch] to facilitate the rapid
exchange of information.

<H2>
Important Dates</H2>

<UL>
 <LI>Thursday, 28.11.96 - 15.00: Submission of material due.
 <LI>Friday, 29.11.96 - 12.00: Notification of submitted material.
 <LI>Friday, 13.12.96: Workshop at the University of Bern
</UL>


<H2>
Submission Guidelines</H2>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Be focussed.</STRONG>
Propose only one idea. We all know that you are a
quality researcher with plenty of good ideas. Only, we have limited
resources and we must focus. In this stage of the project, you are the
only person to judge what's your most promising idea.

<LI><STRONG>Be careful.</STRONG>
Propose an idea that is relevant to some achievement
within the FAMOOS project. Our research is not supposed to live in an
ivory tower.

<LI><STRONG>Be innovative.</STRONG>
Propose some recent idea that still has some
unfinished sides to it. We want to do some work on this idea,
remember.  And of course, since the idea has some unfinished sides to
it, it will probably not completely match with one of the FAMOOS
achievements. That's allright, one of the possible aims of the workshop
is to help you formulating how your idea may contribute to the
workshop.

<LI><STRONG>Be productive.</STRONG>
Reuse an existing article, chapter, outline,
presentation. For the moment, we don't want you to spend too much time
in writing the idea on paper, as there is no guarantee that it will get
"accepted". We only want to get a rough picture and some existing
material is probably good enough to get the idea across.

<LI><STRONG>Be a salesman.</STRONG>
Attach a one page "advertising" abstract to the
submission. This abstract must sell your idea to the group, so it must
at least point out the FAMOOS achievements where it will contribute
to.

<LI><STRONG>Be a provider.</STRONG>
Although we asked you to focus on only one idea, you
probably have other valuable ideas as well. If you want to share these
ideas with the group, you are allowed to include a "loose idea list"
with your submission. This idea-list should be short, but may point to
other interesting material that is online available.

<LI><STRONG>Be electronic.</STRONG>
Submit your material in postcript or HTML, so that we
can collect all of the submissions on a web-site. The abstract (and the loose idea list if you submit one) MUST be
in HTML, so that they can be consulted easily.
Submit everything by e-mail to
[<A HREF = "mailto:demeyer@iam.unibe.ch">demeyer@iam.unibe.ch</A>].

<LI><STRONG>Be a rebel.</STRONG>
Neglect these guidelines if you feel that your idea needs
a special treatment in some way.

</OL>

<H2>
Workshop Agenda (tentative)</H2>

<PRE>
10.00 - 10.30: Welcome & Opening

10.30 - 12.00: Quick Tour
  Each idea in a nutshell, via a 5 minute presentation and 3 minute
  questions for each submission. People are assumed to have read the
  material, so only the important points must be highlighted.  Counting
  on about 10 submissions we should be able to finish that in 80
  minutes.

12.00 - 13.00: Lunch

13.00 - 16.00: Discussion
  We must "organise" this discussion, to maximize our results. Some
  possibilities of group-meeting techniques are:
    * create a network using post-its and threads
    * split up in smaller groups to form clusters of common interest
    * a friendly "voting" process
    * ...
  (It's best to wait with deciding on the "how" untill we have some
  feeling on the "what". In the meantime, anyone that has suggestions
  on how to tackle the discussion is free to send an e-mail to
  "<A HREF = "mailto:demeyer@iam.unibe.ch">demeyer@iam.unibe.ch</A>")
</PRE>

<H2>
Concluding Remarks</H2>

This "call for participation" is supposed to be a living document:
you're free to give feedback on any part of it. The latest version will
be made available on the FAMOOS web-site at the university of Bern
[<A HREF = "http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/">http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~famoos/</A>
