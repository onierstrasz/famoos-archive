 2nd FAMOOS Workshop -- Methodology Providers
 <BR>Bern, Friday December, 13th
 </H1>
 <EM>Version 0.6 -- Latest Revision: October, 1rst, 1997</EM>
</CENTER>

<H2>
Objective</H2>

The methodology providers in the FAMOOS project (i.e.,
FZI-Forschungscentrum Informatik and UOB-University of Bern) are
assigned the responsibility for devising a generic object-oriented
reengineering methodology. Being research institutes, the methodology
providers are especially well suited for that task, as they have a good
overview on the state of the art in object-oriented software
engineering, having even contributed to the field themselves.

<P>To remain at the leading edge in object-oriented research, the
methodology providers must continue to work on innovative ideas. The
FAMOOS project serves as a testbed for a number of these ideas, so it
is in the interest of the project to identify viable ideas as early as
possible. The methodology providers have agreed that their next FAMOOS
meeting will be devoted to a workshop on the issue of idea
identification.

<H2>
Submissions</H2>
In order to make efficient use of time and money, workshop participants
were asked to submit some material in advance. You can read more about
the submission process in the "Call For Participation"
[<A HREF = "wrkshpCFP961213.html">CFP</A>].
