<H1>SCG / FAMOOS / Reengineering Patterns</H1>

<P>This document collects a number of reengineering patterns
explaining you possible approaches for reengineering (or reverse
engineering) object-oriented legacy systems.

<BR>Don't forget to <A HREF =
"http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/pxs/reengineering-patterns.html"> join
the reengineering mailing list hosted at Edinburgh</a> and <A
HREF="mailto:famoos@iam.unibe.ch">to send us feedback about the
patterns.</A></P>

<H2>Current Status</H2>

<P>The current reengineering patterns are all <EM>canditate</EM>
reengineering patterns. This means that they need further iterations
and to become full-blown reengineering patterns. Some of them have
been workshopped at EuroPLOP'98 and EuroPLOP'99 but we are actively
looking for other places to obtain feedback, that's why we make
everything available on the web.</P>

<!--
<P>We also maintain a list of 'work in progress' patterns in a
wiki-web page. You can check this out at <A HREF =
"../../../cgi-bin/scgwiki.cgi?ReverseEngineeringAndReengineeringPatterns">http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/cgi-bin/scgwiki.cgi</A></P>

<DL>

<DT><EM>Type Check Elimination</EM></DT>

<DD>These two patterns tell you how you might eliminate
type-checks by exploiting polymorphic features in OO languages.

  <DT><EM>A Pattern Language for Reverse Engineering</EM></DT>

<DD>This is an (incomplete) pattern language explaining you how to
reverse engineer an object-oriented legacy system, going from the
first contact you have with the system (i.e., Read All the Code in One
Hour), up untill you are preparing to actually reengineer the system
(i.e., Write the Tests).

<H2>The Future</H2>
We are currently rewriting these patterns to form a handbook on
object-oriented reengineering. The working title is 'Object-Oriented
Reengineering: A Pattern-based Approach' and it is expected to appear
in the first quarter of 2001.

<H2> We Need Your Feedback! </H2>
<P>The candidate patterns need to be improved. That's why we need your help. 

If you: 
<UL>
<LI> Like the patterns,</LI>
<LI> Dislike the patterns,</LI>
<LI> Have applied other patterns or these patterns, </LI>
<LI> Any kind of comments, </LI>
</UL>

... please do not hesitate to write us. Send us e-mail (<A
HREF="mailto:famoos@iam.unibe.ch">famoos@iam.unibe.ch</A>)
containing your feedback, or check out the '<A HREF =
"../../../cgi-bin/scgwiki.cgi?ReverseEngineeringAndReengineeringPatterns">work
in progress</A>' patterns to see where we are heading.
-->

<H2>Submitting your own Reengineering Patterns</H2>

<P>We are also interested in other reengineering patterns.  So if you
experience in applying reengineering patterns or with reengineering
techniques write us about your experience. We welcome patterns from
any author wishing to contribute.  If you have an idea and you are
looking for a co-author, we would also be interested.</P>

<H2> Related Web Page </H2>

<P>We are in contact with Perdita Stevens and Rob Pooley at University of
Edinburgh. They are also working on reengineering patterns. So do not
hesitate to register to their mailing list and to read their patterns
