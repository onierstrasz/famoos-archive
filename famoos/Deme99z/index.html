<DT>Abstract:</DT>
  <DD>	Reverse engineering is the process of uncovering the design and
the design rationale from a functioning software system.
Reverse engineering is an integral part of any successful
software system, because changing requirements lead to
implementations that drift from their original design. In
contrast to traditional reverse engineering techniques -which
analyse a single snapshot of a system- we focus the reverse
engineering effort by determining where the implementation has
changed. Since changes of object-oriented software are often
phrased in terms of refactorings, we propose a set of
heuristics for detecting refactorings by applying lightweight,
object-oriented metrics to successive versions of a software
system. We validate our approach with three separate case
studies of mature object-oriented software systems for which
multiple versions are available. The case studies suggest that
the heuristics support the reverse engineering process by
focusing attention on the relevant parts of a software system.</DD>
